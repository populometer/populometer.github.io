        <p>Hi!</p>

<p>Welcome to the populometer website.
Populometer is a amazing app allowing you to find places you want to go based on live reviews!</p>

<h2>Why using populometer?</h2>

<p>How often did you go to a place, thinking that you would find a certain kind of ambiance or a certain kind of people, and left disapointed because there was this special event, or just because it was a bad day for the bar you wanted to go?
How often, after a hard day, did you want to go to a small place in order to relax with friends, and you were tricked because of a fancy band playing here and waste your night?</p>

<p>This is because we believe that your nights out should always match your expectencies that we have created populometer. Sign up using foursquare and start being having always great nights.</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>
